# MLE

## Purpose
**Minimal Language Expression** is a project aimed to reduced a written language (based on an alphabet) to its minimal expression while still being readable/retrievable.

## About dictionaries
Most dictionaries gathered in this repo have been extracted from *Aspell*. For some languages, the dictionaries have been extracted from some other public releases.

## New languages
More languages can be added upon request.

**Note**: Languages must have pronunciation-based alphabets.
