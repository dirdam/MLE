# MLE

**Minimal Language Expression** is a project aimed to reduce a written language (based on an alphabet) to its minimal expression while still being readable/retrievable.

## About the dictionaries
Most dictionaries gathered in this repo have been extracted from [Aspell](http://aspell.net/). For some languages, the dictionaries have been extracted from some other public releases.

## New languages
More languages can be added upon request.

**Note**: Languages must have pronunciation-based alphabets.
